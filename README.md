Elements in HTML are of two types

- inline elements: They donot completely block the width of the viewport. Do not pushes elements to the next line if possible.

# Fonts

# Selectors in CSS

3. Class Selector

# CSS Units

There are two types of units.

1. Absolute Units: The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

    Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout. ex. px cm in

2. Relative Units: Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.
    ex. %, em, rem, vm, vh
